Reproductive analysis of a specimen of "Ephippion guttifer"
A single individual of Ephippion guttifer was captured in 2025 in the Atlantic waters of the coast of Galicia, northwestern Spain (Ría de Pontevedra). For reproductive analysis, four sub-samples (20-46 mg in weight) from anterior, central and posterior part of the lobe were taken to estimate fecundity by applying the gravimetric method combined with the whole-mounts method. Oocytes were separated from connective tissue using a washing process (modified from Lowerre-Barbieri and Barbieri) and by size with sieve of 500 µm. All sub-samples were photographed using a stereo microscope Nikon SMZ18 connected to a video camera Nikon Fi13. Oocytes were counted and measured using the software Fiji. Oocyte density per sub-sample (oocytes per gram of ovary weight, OD), as well as potential (PF) and relative (PFrel) fecundity (oocytes and oocytes per gram of female weight, respectively) were estimated with the package stats of the software R and RStudio console, results were plotted with the package ggplot2.
